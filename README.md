# Running the code

Actually compiling the code requires running `cargo run`

`cargo` can be acquired by installing `rustup`.
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

Alternatively, `nn1r` should be runnable on the target triple: `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

The Rust code trains the models and dumps some data which is later visualized in
`conv_weight_vis.ipynb`
